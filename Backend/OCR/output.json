	"Text": "The city today launched an ambitious tree-planting initiative aimed at reducing urban heat and improving air quality. Mayor Lina Perez announced the program, which will plant 10,000 trees over two years in parks, streetscapes, and community spaces. The effort is expected to increase canopy cover, provide habitat for urban wildlife, and create cooling effects during summer months. Residents are invited to volunteer at weekend planting events.",
